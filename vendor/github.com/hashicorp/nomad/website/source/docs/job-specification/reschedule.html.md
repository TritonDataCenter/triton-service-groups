  The "reschedule" stanza specifies the group's rescheduling strategy upon
  allocation failures. The reschedule strategy can be configured with number
  of attempts and a time interval. Nomad will only attempt to reschedule
  failed allocations on to another node only after any local [restarts](docs/job-specification/restart.html)
  have been exceeded.

# `reschedule` Stanza

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th width="120">Placement</th>
    <td>
      <code>job -> **reschedule**</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      <code>job -> group -> **reschedule**</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The `reschedule` stanza specifies the group's rescheduling strategy. It can be
configured with number of attempts and a time interval. If specified at the job
level, the configuration will apply to all groups within the job. If the
reschedule stanza is present on both the job and the group, they are merged with
the group stanza taking the highest precedence and then the job.

Nomad will attempt to schedule the task on another node if any of its allocation
statuses become "failed". It prefers to create a replacement allocation on a node
that hasn't previously been used.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    reschedule {
      attempts = 3
      interval = "15m"
    }
  }
}
```

~> The reschedule stanza does not apply to `system` jobs because they run on
   every node.

## `reschedule` Parameters

- `attempts` `(int: <varies>)` - Specifies the number of reschedule attempts
   allowed in the configured interval. Defaults vary by job type, see below
   for more information.

- `interval` `(string: <varies>)` - Specifies the sliding window which begins
   when the first reschedule attempt starts and ensures that only `attempts`
   number of reschedule happen within it. If more than `attempts` number of
   failures happen with this interval, Nomad will not reschedule any more.

Information about reschedule attempts are displayed in the CLI and API for
allocations. Rescheduling is enabled by default for service and batch jobs
with the options shown below.

### `reschedule` Parameter Defaults

The values for the `reschedule` parameters vary by job type. Below are the
defaults by job type:

- The Default Batch Reschedule Policy is:

    ```hcl
    reschedule {
      attempts = 1
      interval = "24h"
    }
    ```

- The Default Service Reschedule Policy is:

    ```hcl
    reschedule {
      interval = "1h"
      attempts = 2
    }
    ```

### Rescheduling during deployments

The [update stanza](docs/job-specification/update.html) controls rolling updates and canary deployments. A task
group's reschedule stanza does not take affect during a deployment. For example, if a new version of the job
is rolled out and the deployment failed due to a failing allocation, Nomad will not reschedule it.

### Disabling rescheduling ###

To disable rescheduling, set the `attempts` parameter to zero.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    reschedule {
      attempts = 0
    }
  }
}
```
