# Nomad Enterprise

[Nomad Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/nomad/) adds collaboration
and governance capabilities to Nomad. With Nomad Enterprise, operators can enable
multiple teams to safely use a single multi-region deployment, limit resource
consumption across teams or projects, and enforce arbitrary fine-grained policies
upon job submission. Nomad Enterprise features include:

- [Namespaces](/docs/enterprise/namespaces/index.html)
- [Resource Quotas](/docs/enterprise/quotas/index.html)
- [Sentinel Policies](/docs/enterprise/sentinel/index.html)

These features are part of [Nomad Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/nomad/).
